# Echelon

A modular Node.js Discord bot powered by [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

With a focus on expandability, Echelon was engineered to streamline the process of adding new commands and information.

## Features

Echelon comes equipped with some helpful features out-of-the-box.

#### Custom Profanity Filter

Within the `banned-words.json` file, there are two arraysâ€”one named `banned` and the other `special`. The `banned` array will contain a list of plaintext words that are to be blocked. The `special` array will contain premade regex expressions.

Here is an example:
```
{
    "banned": ["apple", "banana", "orange"],
    "special": ["\\by+\\s*o+\\b", "\\bh+\\s*i+\\b"]
}
```

The following words *will* trigger this configuration:
`bapple` `app pple` `bannnana` `b a n a n a` `oorangege` `yoo` `hhi`
The following words *will not* trigger the configuration:
`b a n n n a n a` `byoo` `hiya` `yoop`

#### Practical Commands
Echelon comes with 8 prebuilt commands:

|         Commands        |   Requirements   |
|:-----------------------:|:----------------:|
|     `about` `covid`     |       None       |
|  `apex` `genius` `lol`  |     API Keys     |
| `mystats` `serverstats` |      MongoDB     |
|        `votekick`       | Work-in-Progress |

##### Command Prefix

The default command prefix for Echelon is `!`, but can be easily changed in the `config.json` file.

##### API Keys

The `apex`, `genius`, and `lol` commands fetch data from services that require API keys. `covid` is does not require an API key as it relies on a public API. Read more about the COVID-19 API [here](https://covidtracking.com/data/api). If you wish to use these commands, obtain API keys from the services listed below.

|  Command |            Service            |              Website             |
|:--------:|:-----------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
|  `apex`  | Apex Legends API (*unofficial*) |    https://apexlegendsapi.com    |
| `genius` |           Genius API          |      https://docs.genius.com     |
|   `lol`  |         Riot Games API        | https://developer.riotgames.com/ |

#### MongoDB Support

By linking Echelon to a MongoDB database, Echelon will collect information about the users in each server, including the number of commands used and the amount of bad words typed. A different database is used for each server, making user data independent.

If no MongoDB database is linked, the bot will still work, but some commands will be disabled, as they rely on the database.
